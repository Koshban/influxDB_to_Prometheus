# InfluxDB Exporter

A Pythonic version of <https://github.com/prometheus/influxdb_exporter>

The given code is a Python program that sets up an InfluxDB exporter. It collects metrics from InfluxDB and exposes them for monitoring and analysis. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The code defines several variables and constants, such as `MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD`, `listenAddress`, `metricsPath`, etc.
2. It defines several classes: `InfluxDBSample`, `InfluxV2Health`, `ErrorResponse`, and `InfluxDBCollector`. These classes are used to store and process data related to InfluxDB metrics.
3. The code defines a function `replace_invalid_chars` that replaces invalid characters in a string with underscores.
4. It defines a function `json_error_response` that generates a JSON error response.
5. The code defines a class `influxDBSample` that represents a sample of an InfluxDB metric.
6. The code defines a function `init` that initializes the InfluxDB registry and registers collectors.
7. The code defines a function `main` that sets up the InfluxDB exporter. It creates a logger, initializes the collector, sets up UDP listener, and handles HTTP requests for metrics, queries, ping, health, and default routes.
8. Finally, the code checks if the script is being run as the main module and calls the `main` function. Overall, this code sets up an InfluxDB exporter that collects metrics from InfluxDB and exposes them through an HTTP server for monitoring and analysis.
